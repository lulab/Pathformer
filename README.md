## Pathformer: a biological pathway informed Transformer for disease diagnosis and prognosis using multi-omics data

Multi-modal biological data integration can provide comprehensive views of gene regulation and cell development. However, conventional integration methods rarely utilize prior biological knowledge and lack interpretability. To address these two challenges, we developed Pathformer, which is to our knowledge the first Transformer-based multi-modal integration model that incorporates biological pathway knowledge. Pathformer leverages criss-cross attention mechanism to capture crosstalk between different biological pathways and between different modalities (i.e., multi-omics). It also utilizes SHapley Additive Explanation method to reveal key pathways, genes, and regulatory mechanisms.Pathformer performs classification tasks with high accuracy and biological interpretability, which can be applied to the liquid biopsy data for noninvasive cancer diagnosis.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps

### Prerequisites

python 3.6.9, check environments.yml for list of needed packages

### Installation

1.Clone the repo

```git clone https://github.com/lulab/Pathformer.git```

2.Create conda environment

```conda env create --name Pathformer --file=environment.yml```

## Usage

### 1.Activate the created conda environment

```source activate Pathformer```

### 2.Data preprocessing

Through benchmark studies on 20 TCGA datasets, we demonstrated the superior performance and interpretability of Pathformer on various cancer classification tasks, compared to 18 other integration models. Furthermore, we applied Pathformer to liquid biopsy multi-modal data integration with high accuracy in cancer diagnosis.

In **```data_preprocessing_TCGA```** folder, we provide TCGA data downloading and preprocessing methods. Here we take the breast cancer dataset as an example. More details see README in **```data_preprocessing_TCGA```** folder.

In **```data_preprocessing_cfRNA```** folder, we provide liquid biopsy data preprocessing methods. Here we collected two types of body fluid datasets: the plasma dataset and the platelet dataset. More details see README in **```data_preprocessing_cfRNA```** folder.

### 3.Model training and test.

For model training and test, we divided the labeled dataset into the train set (80%) and the test set (20%) hierarchically. Then, we used validation set (20% of training set) for model early stopping and hyperparameter optimizatio.

#### 3.2 Examples of Pathformer model test for the EV dataset classification

For liquid biopsy data,the training function is the same as TCGA data, but the parameter inputs are different. Here we take the plasma dataset as an example.

```
cd Pathformer_code
python3 Pathformer_main.py \
--modal_all_path ../Result/plasma/modal_type_all.txt \
--modal_select_path ../Result/plasma/modal_type_all.txt \
--gene_all ../reference/gene_mRNA_cfRNA.txt \
--gene_select ../reference/Pathformer_select_gene.txt \
--pathway_gene_w ../reference/Pathformer_pathway_gene_weight.npy \
--pathway_crosstalk_network  ../reference/Pathformer_pathway_crosstalk_network_matrix.npy \
--data_path ../data_cfRNA/3.data_gene_embedding/merge/plasma/data_all.npy \

--save_path ../Result/plasma/ \
--dataset 1 \
--model_name plasma \
--model_save True \
--batch_size 8 \
--gradient_num 4 \
--epoch_num 2000 \
--early_stopping_type f1_macro_2 \
--patience 10 \
--delta 1e-2 \
--stop_epoch 100 \
--test_each_epoch_no 1 \
--depth 3 \

--attn_dropout 0.2 \
--ff_dropout 0.2 \
--classifier_dropout 0.3 \
--lr_max 1e-5 \
--lr_min 1e-8
```
The parameter description is the same as section 3.1.

### 4.Model interpretability.

To better understand Pathformer’s decisions, we increased the interpretability of Pathformer by calculating contributions of different modalities, important pathways and their key genes, and hub module of the updated pathway crosstalk network. The contributions of different modalities are calculated by averaging attention maps in row-attention. The important pathways and their key genes are defined by SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP value). The hub module of the updated pathway crosstalk network is screened by sub-network scores based on SHAP values of pathways.

Here we take breast cancer subtype classification as an example, and the calculation is as follows:
```
cd Pathformer_code
bash ../Pathformer_Interpretability/log_BRCA_survival.sh
```
